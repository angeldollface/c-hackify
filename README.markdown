## ABOUT :books:

Since I have been slowly learning more abou the C programming language and I was wondering what to implement, 
I thought I'd re-implement, [this tool] I wrote in C++, in C. This repository contains the source code for this re-implementation. Enjoy! :heart:

## INSTALLATION :hammer:

To install *C-Hackify*, make sure that you have the following tools installed and available from the command line:

- A C compiler
- [Git](https://git-scm.org)
- CMake

Assuming you have these tools available, execute the following commands from a command prompt:

- 1.) Download this repository's source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angeldollface/c-hackify.git
```

- 2.) Change directory into the source directory's root:

```bash
cd c-hackify
```

- 3.) Build the `c-hackify` executable:

```bash
make build
```

- 4.) Move the generated executable to a location on your system's `$PATH`. You may have to change permissions.

## USAGE :hammer:

Assuming you installed ***C-Hackify*** correctly, you can now use the `hackify` command like this:

```bash
hackify "Hello World!"
```

This will output the following string:

```text
H3ll0 W0rld!
```
